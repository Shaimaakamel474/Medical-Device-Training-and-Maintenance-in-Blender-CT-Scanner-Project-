#  Medical Device Training and Maintenance in Blender (CT Scanner Project)

This project simulates training and maintenance procedures for a **CT (Computed Tomography) scanner** using **Blender**.  
It was developed as part of the **Medical Device Training and Maintenance in Blender** course project.

##  Project Description

The simulation features animated **trainer and trainee characters** performing realistic tasks in a radiology room environment.  
Characters interact with the **CT scanner**, tools, and each other while demonstrating proper **operation and maintenance steps**.

The environment includes:
- Realistic lighting, materials, and textures  
- Collision detection between characters and objects  
- Character movement in multiple directions
